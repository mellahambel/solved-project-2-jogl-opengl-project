<strong>Overview </strong>

In this project you will create a unique 3 scene composed of OpenGL graphic components using transformation methods.

<strong>Requirements: </strong>

<ol>

 <li>Using Netbeans or Eclipse, develop a JOGL application that displays a unique 3D scene. The scene has the following specifications:

  <ol>

   <li>Size: 640Ã—480</li>

   <li>Includes at least 6 different shapes</li>

   <li>Uses at least 6 different transformation methods</li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>




<ol start="2">

 <li>Use Java and JOGL for your implementation of OpenGL</li>

 <li>All Java source code should be written using Google Java style guide.</li>

 <li>Prepare, conduct and document a test plan verifying each method is functioning properly. (Hint: Using JUNIT tests are recommended)</li>

</ol>

<strong>Deliverables: </strong>

<ol>

 <li>All Java source code used for this project. Code should adhere to the Google Java style guide.</li>

 <li>Word or PDF file demonstrating with clearly labeled screen captures and associated well-written descriptions, the successful execution of your 3D graphics scene. The document should be wellwritten, well-organized, include page numbers, captions for all screen captures, and a title page including your name, class, section number and date. References should be included for all sources used and formatted in APA style.</li>

</ol>
